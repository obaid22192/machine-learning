The "Predict" API allows user to get the prediction value of desired dataset. Using this API user can do the following things:

Register: Registration page allows user to sign in with email and password.

Login: The same email and password can be used to login.

Create new project: After login user can create a number of projects. 

Upload dataset: Creating new project will enable to upload the dataset user wants to use  to get the prediction value.

Prediction:  User will select the label for which they want the prediction value. Then they can choose the features. They can choose different machine learning algorithms. Choosing multiple algorithms will allow to compare the prediction results. Different  algorithms provide different results. So, algorithm choice should be depend on the kind of prediction user would like to see. Classification algorithms will be the best choice to see different category within data. Regression algorithms will be useful to get the future prediction value. 

Accuracy: Accuracy rate will be shown for different machine learning algorithmâ€™s prediction value. It provides the ability to choose which algorithm to choose, based on higher accuracy rate.
