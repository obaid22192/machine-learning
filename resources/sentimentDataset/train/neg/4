My guests are not arriving now
Jennie has no money
Janetta doesn’t miss her mom
I rarely go to the gym after work
Paul did not call me yesterday
I do not like this restaurant
I am tired of this stuff
I can't deal with this
he is my sworn enemy!
my boss is horrible
Jamilee never went to the grocery store
I couldn’t find no paper
I couldn’t
That attitude won’t get you nowhere
The pilot can’t find no place to land
I hardly have no money
I can’t get no satisfaction
